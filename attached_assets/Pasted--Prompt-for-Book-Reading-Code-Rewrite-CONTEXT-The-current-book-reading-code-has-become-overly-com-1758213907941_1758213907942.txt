📋 Prompt for Book Reading Code Rewrite
CONTEXT: The current book reading code has become overly complex with heavy Redux state management, multiple service contexts, over-parameterized components, and intricate hook architectures. The goal is to create a simpler, more maintainable book reading experience that follows the clean patterns seen in AdminBookUpload.tsx.

CURRENT COMPLEXITY ISSUES TO SOLVE:

Over-engineered State Management:

bookStore.ts has 15+ state transitions, complex Redux actions, global state synchronization
useBookStateManager has 200+ lines managing Redux, API calls, and AI function calls
Heavy Service Dependencies:

StorybookDisplay requires 15+ props including openaiConnection, workflowStateMachine, onAppuSpeakingChange
ServiceManagerContext creates tight coupling between unrelated services
Functional Complexity:

Mixed concerns: UI display, state management, API calls, AI integration all intertwined
Function call handling for AI tools embedded deep in React hooks
REWRITE REQUIREMENTS:

✅ KEEP (Core Functionality):

Book search and selection
Page-by-page display with images and text
Page navigation (next/previous) with animations
Audio playback integration for page narration
AI integration (Appu can search books, display pages)
Close/exit book reading mode
❌ SIMPLIFY (Architecture):

Remove Redux completely - Use simple React state like AdminBookUpload.tsx
Eliminate ServiceManagerContext dependency - Direct API calls like admin page
Reduce StorybookDisplay props from 15+ to ~5 essential ones
Move AI function handling to simple API endpoints instead of complex hook chains
Use TanStack Query for API state management (like admin page)
🎯 TARGET ARCHITECTURE (Follow AdminBookUpload.tsx Pattern):

// Simplified book reading page structure
function BookReading() {
  // Simple state (no Redux)
  const [selectedBook, setSelectedBook] = useState<Book | null>(null);
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
  const [pageData, setPageData] = useState<PageData | null>(null);
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  // TanStack Query for API calls (like AdminBookUpload)
  const { data: books } = useQuery({ queryKey: ['books'], queryFn: fetchBooks });
  const { data: pageContent } = useQuery({ 
    queryKey: ['book-page', selectedBook?.id, currentPage],
    queryFn: () => fetchBookPage(selectedBook?.id, currentPage)
  });
  // Simple functions (no complex hooks)
  const handleBookSearch = async (query: string) => { /* Simple fetch */ };
  const handleNextPage = () => { /* Simple state update */ };
  const handlePlayAudio = () => { /* Simple audio control */ };
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Simple component with minimal props */}
      <BookDisplay 
        pageData={pageContent}
        onNextPage={handleNextPage}
        onPreviousPage={handlePreviousPage}
        onClose={() => setSelectedBook(null)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
📁 NEW FILE STRUCTURE:

✅ client/src/pages/BookReading.tsx - Main reading page (simple state)
✅ client/src/components/BookDisplay.tsx - Clean display component (5 props max)
✅ client/src/hooks/useBookAudio.tsx - Simple audio playback hook
❌ Remove: bookStore.ts, useBookStateManager.ts, ServiceManagerContext dependency
🔗 AI INTEGRATION (Simplified):

Book Search: Simple /api/books/search endpoint (already exists)
Page Display: Simple /api/books/:id/pages/:page endpoint
AI Function Calls: Handle in parent component, not deep in hooks
🎨 UI REQUIREMENTS:

Keep the beautiful animations and visual design from current StorybookDisplay
Maintain page flipping animations and responsive layout
Preserve audio integration and playback controls
Keep the same user experience, just simpler code architecture
🚀 SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Reduced complexity: <100 lines for main book reading logic
Fewer dependencies: No Redux, minimal context usage
Cleaner component props: BookDisplay has ≤5 props
Maintainable: Follows same patterns as AdminBookUpload.tsx
Full functionality: All current features work (search, display, navigate, audio, AI)
DO NOT:

Change the user experience or visual design
Remove any core functionality
Break AI integration (Appu should still be able to search/display books)
Over-engineer with new patterns - keep it simple like the admin page
This prompt focuses on architectural simplicity while preserving all functionality, following the successful patterns already established in your cleaner admin code.
